# Introducion to SQL
## Defining Relationship Schemas in SQL
The current standard for SQL is __SQL-99__.  There are two aspects to SQL:    
1. The __Data-Definition__ to declare database schemas    
2. The __Data_Manipulation__ sub-language for querying/modifying databases    

### Relations in SQL
SQL makes a distinction between three kinds of relations:   
1. __Stored relations__, which are called __tables__    
2. __Views__, which are relations designed by some computation.  This relations are not stored, but constructed when needed   
3. __Temporary Tables__ which are constructed by the SQL language processor when executing queries and data modifications.  These relations are not stored and discarded when no longer used.   

To declare a schema for a stored relation, do the following

```
CREATE TABLE -- SOME TABLE NAME --
```

### Data Types
The following are primitive data types that are supported by SQL    

#### Character Strings
They can be of fixed or variable length.  To type a fixed length character string, use `CHAR(n)` for some length $n$.  To create a variable length character string, use `VARCHAR(n)` for some length $n$.  If a component of a tuple with a domain of `CHAR(n)` is given and the length of the component is less than $n$, the component is padded with white space. 

#### Bit Strings
Bit strings can be of fixed or varying length. This data type is analogous to character strings, but their values are strings of bits rather than characters.

#### BOOLEANs
Booleans denote an attribute whose value is logical.  The possible values that a boolean can take are __TRUE, FALSE, UNKNOWN__.

#### INTs
Ints or (Integers) denote some integer value.  `SHORTINT` is also an int but is may have less bits.

#### Floating-Point Numbers
Floating points are denoted by `FLOAT` or `REAL`.  If you would like higher precision with floats, use `DOUBLE PRECISION`.  Like character strings, floats can be of fixed decimal length.  You can declare decimal length but calling `DECIMAL(n, d)` where $n$ is the total number of digits allowed for the float nad $d$ is the number of digits passed the decimal. 

#### Dates and Times
Dates and times are declared using `DATE` and `TIME` respectively. Dates and times are a special form of character strings.  Adding a string after the `DATE` declaration specifies the format of the date.  For example `DATE '1948-05-14'` creates a date value with the form "YYYY-MM-DD".  The same can be done with time.  For example `TIME '15:00:02.5'` specifies that you want to represent time with the format "HH:MM:SS" with the attachment of milliseconds. 

The follow is a simple example of a Relation Schema declaration

```{SQL}
CREATE TABLE Movies(
  title CHAR(100) -- Character string with 100 characters
  ,year INT
  ,lengh INT
  ,genre CHAR(10)
  ,studioName CHAR(30)
  ,producerC# INT
);
```

### Modifying Relation Schemas
To delete or "drop" a table from a database, execute the following    

```{SQL}
DROP TABLE -- SOME TABLE --;
```

When dropping at able, the table no longer exists in the database schema.  To modify and existing table, use the `ALTER` keyword   

```{SQL}
---- Modifying a table to add a new attribute to its schema ----
ALTER TABLE -- SOME TABLE -- ADD -- SOME ATTRIBUTE -- CHAR(16); 

---- Modifying a table to remove an attribute from its schema ----
ALTER TABLE -- SOME TABLE -- DROP -- SOME ATTRIBUTE IN SCHEMA --; 
```

### Default Values
When adding a new attribute to a relation's schema, all tuples require some value for that attribute.  Database systems will default that value to `NULL`, but what if you want a specific value for it default to?  What if data is uploaded randomly and not all tuples have values for each component?   In this case we can use the `DEFAULT` keyword to add a specific value instead using `NULL`.

```{SQL}
---- Creating attributes and adding a default value when no data is made available ----
gender CHAR(1) DEFAULT '?'
name VARCHAR(10) DEFAULT 'No Name :('
```

#### Declaring Keys
There are two ways to assign a set of attributes to be a key.  Keys are defined in the declaration of the database schema, i.e. the  `CREATE TABLE` statement.

Use `PRIMARY KEY` or `UNIQUE` to declare a set of attributes to be a key.  Remember, that keys must always be unique for each tuple.  The difference between `PRIMARY KEY` and `UNIQUE` is that components a tuple are allowed to have `NULL` as a value when using `UNIQUE`.  On the other hand, using `PRIMARY KEY` does not allow `NULL` to be in a key.

```{SQL}
---- Assigning name as a primary key ---
CREATE TABLE MovieStar(
  name CHAR(30) PRIMARY KEY
  ,address VARCHAR(255)
  ,gender CHAR(1)
  ,birthdate DATE
);

---- You can assign keys after declaring all attributes as well! ----
CREATE TABLE MovieStar(
  name CHAR(30)
  ,address VARCHAR(255)
  ,gender CHAR(1)
  ,birthdate DATE
  PRIMARY KEY (name)
);
```
