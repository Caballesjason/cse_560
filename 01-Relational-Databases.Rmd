#  Relational Databases
## What is a data model?
A data model is an abstract model to describe a collection of data and how we can interact with it.  Data models can also be represented mathematically. For example

- Relational Models $\rightarrow$ Tables
- Semi-structured Models $\rightarrow$ Trees/graphs (Think of XML and HTML files)

Data models contain three parts:    

1. Structure of Data - How is data organized?
2. Operation on Data - What actions can we commit to the data?
3. Constraints on Data - What rules are applied to the data?

\

## The Relational Data Model
There are two mainstream types of data models:

1. Relational Models
2. Semi-structured Models

___This course will primarily focus on Relational Models.___

Data is organized in a two-dimensional table called a relation and have a series of operations based off relational algebra that can be applied to the table.  Relational models also include object-relational models that add storage to non-primitive objects and methods for tables.

Why do we use relational models?  Relational models are simple and intuitive to use.  They are also the models that underlie SQL.

\

### Relational Models: Structure, Operations, Constraints
__Column headers__ are called __attributes__ and they describe the information being provided for that column.  The __relation schema__ describes the name of a relation and the set of all attributes (and possibly with their data types) for the relation.

__Attributes in__ a __schema__ are a __set__ and __NOT__ a list (all values are unique and order does not matter).  On the other hand, when creating a relation schema, the order of attributes matter.  

   

The rows of a __relation__ are called __Tuples__ where each value for each attribute for the tuple is called the __component__ of that attribute.  Tuples have one component for each attribute provided by the schema.   In practice, we start a relation name with a capital letter and attributes with a lowercase letter.   The __domain__ of an attribute/component is the __data type__ associated with it.  __All domains__ must be of __atomic__ (primitive) data types.  

Relations are sets of tuples and therefore all tuples in a relation are unique and the order of the tuples does not matter.

A __subset of tuples__ from a relation is known as an __instance of that relation__.   We can reorder attributes and therefore, the components of an instance's tuples, however changing the order of a relation's schema changes the default attribute order of new instances of that relation. 

Database systems store a relation instance that mimics the relation's schema.  This is instance is known as the __current instance__.   Past versions of the current instance are called __temporal instances__

Finally, the __set of schemas for relations__ in a database is know as a "__Database Schema__".

### Relation Keys
A set of attributes in a relation form a __key__ if we do not allow two tuples in a relation to have the same values for that set of attributes,  that is, for each tuple, their components must be unique to all other tuples for the attributes assigned to be a key.  If a set of attributes is a key for a relation, then the same set of attributes must be a key for all instances of that relation.  Keys are pretty common in industry and many real-world databases use artificial keys (think UB person Number).

In database systems, relations can have one primary key.  Primary keys can have `NULL` as a value for a one of its components provided that you allow the relation to do so.

## Expressing Tables without Relational Algebra and SQL

In this section, we will notation for expressing relations.

To express a relation, we will first declare its name (remember that the first letter is capitalized), then we will declare its attributes surrounded by parentheses.  Any attributes that are underlined indicates that that attribute is part of the relation's key.

For example:

\

$$
Movies(\underline{name}, date, genre)
$$

\

In this example, the relation's name is $Movies$.  $Movies$ has three attributes ($name$, $date$, $genre$).  $name$ is a key for this relation.
